To customize source code BEFORE building qgis set:
QGIS_PRE_CUSTOMIZE_DIR

To customize qgis install, AFTER post install steps, set:
QGIS_POST_CUSTOMIZE_DIR

Set environment variables prior to running `conda build ... qgis`

In either directory, place .bat scripts and files in a directory. Each
directory will be entered and any .bat file found will be called in
alpha-numeric order.

PRE_CUSTOMIZE examples:
- Change graphics to be compiled into Qt RC file, e.g. splash screen
- Patch src code when necessary for graphics customization

POST_CUSTOMIZE examples:
- Add custom plugins
- Place a qgis_global_settings.ini in <prefix>\Library\apps\qgis
